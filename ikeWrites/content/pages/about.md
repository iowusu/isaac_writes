Welcome to my realm ‚Äì a place where I wear the hats of a Data Architect navigating the realms of Engineering Data-Intensive Scalable Systems, Graph Databases, Cloud Computing, and the enchanting landscapes of Machine Learning.

But hold on, the adventure doesn't stop there. Beyond the confines of corporate codes and technological enigmas, there's a whole universe waiting to be explored. When I shed my office badge, you'll find me indulging in a variety of passions. From capturing fleeting moments through the lens of a camera to unraveling the threads of art and fashion, my interests are as diverse as they come. Unfortunately, sometimes you may find me pondering when that elusive Ph.D. might finally come knocking at my door. üòÑ

Currently, I call Atlanta, Georgia my home, but my life journey has taken me to fascinating corners of the world. I've lived and thrived in Teachiman, Brong East Ghana; vibrant Accra in Great Accra Ghana; the heartland of Ames, Iowa, USA; the chilly but charming Minneapolis in Minnesota, USA; the steel city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; and the vibrant city of Columbus, Ohio, USA. You might say I've been around the block, and I think it's safe to say, I've got a bit of wanderlust in my veins.

My academic journey includes earning a Bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems from the prestigious Iowa State University (go Cyclones!), followed by a Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) from the esteemed Carnegie Mellon University. Professionally, Amazon Web Services is my playground. 

For the past five years, I've served as a technical consultant within the dynamic field of Technology Professional Services. As the curtains rise on my professional journey, Amazon Web Services steps into the spotlight.

So, if you're curious about the magic behind scalable data systems, the strategic nuances of graph databases, the limitless possibilities of cloud computing, or the fascinating world of machine learning, you're in the right place. Join me on this exciting journey through the realms of technology and beyond. Who knows what adventures lie ahead? Stick around, and let's explore together! üöÄüîç
